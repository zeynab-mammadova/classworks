Sentences.

So far, so good, but previous task generated meaningless sentences.

Right now, the task is quite different.
You still need generate sentences, but with rules.

file: verb_obj.txt contains relations between verbs and objects.

Compose them into meaningful sentences, and put them into the file sentences.txt
